# **Uber Ride Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project**



## Title:



Uber Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI



## Executive Summary:



This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Uber ride data across multiple dimensions such as bookings, revenue, cancellations, ratings, and vehicle performance.

The dashboard provides a clean UI, multi-page navigation, data-driven visuals, and actionable insights that help understand customer behavior and operational performance.



## Business Problem:



Uber generates millions of ride records daily. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to understand:



Which vehicle types perform best



Monthly booking patterns



Payment method preferences



Revenue trends



Cancellation issues



Customer satisfaction levels



The goal is to create a visual analytics system that helps stakeholders quickly interpret data and make informed decisions.



## Methodology:



The project was developed using the following approach:



Data Collection \& Cleaning



Loaded Uber ride dataset



Removed missing/incorrect values



Standardized fields (dates, vehicle names, payments)



Data Modeling



Created relationships



Added DAX measures for KPIs (Total Booking, Revenue, Avg Distance)



Dashboard Design



### Built 5 pages: Overview, Vehicle Type, Revenue, Cancellation, Ratings



Added sidebar navigation using Power BI Page Navigator



Used consistent grey-blue theme with rounded cards



Visualization



Pie charts, bar charts, line charts, area charts



KPI cards, filters, slicers



Custom formatted table with vehicle icons



Insights Extraction



Identified patterns, trends, and operational opportunities



## Skills:



This project demonstrates proficiency in:



Power BI Desktop



Data Cleaning \& Transformation



DAX (Basic Measures)



Interactive Dashboard Design



Business Intelligence \& Data Storytelling



UI/UX principles for analytics



Visualization best practices



## Results \& Business Recommendations:



### Key Results:



Identified top-performing vehicle types by bookings and revenue.



Found monthly ride trends with summer peaks and winter drops.



Payment insight: UPI and Cash were the most preferred methods.



Average distance remained constant across vehicle types.



Cancellation analysis showed specific categories with higher dropout rates.



### Business Recommendations:



Promote high-performing vehicle types through incentives.



Improve cancellation-prone areas by investigating customer complaints.



Scale UPI wallet integration due to strong adoption.



Run targeted campaigns during low-demand months.



Enhance rating system to improve user experience.



## Next Steps:



To further improve this project:



Add forecasting models using Power BI or Python integration.



Include real-time dashboards using streaming datasets.



Deploy the dashboard online using Power BI Service.



Convert the project into a portfolio case study for LinkedIn/GitHub Pages.
